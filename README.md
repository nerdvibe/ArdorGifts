## About this project & motivation 🙏

I found out about Ardor during the <a href="https://ardor.tools/hackathon.html">Ardor Hackathon</a> and found the Ardor project to be pretty interesting, therefore I immediately started to study and hack around the project. The possibilities with Ardor are endless. 

By being a newcommer to the project and wanting to contribute to the project, I started from the base of every blockchain, therefore I decided to build up a paper wallet generator. I believe usualibity is fundamental in the adoption of a blockchain. That's why I mostly focused on the final User Experience (UX).

For sure this is a first project of many...

## How to use 📝
Ardor Gifts works on browser and natively offline on Mac, Linux or Windows. [Here you can try it online](https://ardor.gifts) or [here you can find the downloadable version of Ardor Gifts](https://github.com/tomyum-code/Ardor-Gifts/releases).

## What is a paper wallet? ❓

One of the most exciting things you can do with crypto is to store them to a piece of paper.


First of all, the first rule of crypto-club is: Your keys — Your ARDR, Not your keys — Not your ARDR.
In the most specific sense, an Ardor paper wallet is a document containing all the data necessary to access the wallet from Ardor Wallet or the Ardor Lite Wallet from mobile.

## What are the benefits of having a paper wallet? 💰

A paper wallet can be generated offline and allows you to have a copy of your copy literally on a piece of paper

## What can I do with a paper wallet? 🎁

With an Ardor paper wallet you can store you Ardor passphrase away of a computer. If the paper wallet is stored properly then this might be considered an extra layer of security in storing your passphrase.
Another use case of a paper wallet is to gift it to friends for example for Christmas. Let's say you want to give 10 ARDR to John, but John doesn't know how to create an ARDR wallet. You could create an Ardor Paper Wallet for John, send some Ardor to the generated address and then gift the paper wallet to him.

## How do I generate the paper wallet offline? 👨‍💻

The code of ArdorGifts is open source. You can improve it and submit a PR to the repository. If you need assistance, feel free to contact Tom Yum on the Ardor slack chat.


The safest way to generate a wallet is to [download the application here](https://github.com/tomyum-code/Ardor-Gifts/releases), transfer it into an usb drive, start an offline linux distribution, and open the index.html.


If you don't want to bother to use an offline linux distribution, you can just download [ArdorGifts.zip from here](https://github.com/tomyum-code/Ardor-Gifts/releases), unzip it and execute the index.html. There is no need to be connected to internet while running the ArdorGifts app.

## Do you want to propose a new design for the wallets? ✏️

Awesome! Let's discuss about the new design by opening a new issue on Github.

## FAQ 🐧

### How do I save the wallet as PDF?
Click on the Print button and on the open dialog click `save as PDF`;

### Windows says that is not safe to open the application
This error is because the app is not signed yet. In order to execute it, you will have to click with the right click on the app's icon -> properties and ticking the checkbox `unblock`

### Where is the base PSD template for the wallet?
coming soon!
